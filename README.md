[Data Engineering - Electric Vehicle Activity Pipeline](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/Electric-Vehicle-Activity)
This project aims to develop a pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading data to facilitate the creation of an interactive dashboard. The objective is to visualize trends in the evolving market of electric vehicle (EV) within the state of Washington and analyze EV adoption over time, as well as trends in the market such as leading automakers. Additionally, this project was also part of the DataTalksClub's Engineering Zoomcamp Certification.

[Data Engineering - Brazillian Federal Revenue Pipeline](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/a3-data-engineering-hackathon)
This is a data engineering challenge promoted by A3Data where the task is to implement a data extraction, transformation, and provisioning pipeline. The data source consists of an open database from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service known as "Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica" (CNPJ). 

[SQL - Ecommerce Analysis](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/SQL-projects/tree/main/Brazilian_ecommerce_analysis)
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis for the Olist Ecommerce dataset, which consists of information on 100,000 orders made at Olist Store in Brazil from 2016 to 2018. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the ecommerce business, including customer data, order details, product information, and reviews. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to showcase proficiency in working with multiple tables in SQL to retrieve information and derive valuable insights. By utilizing SQL JOIN operations, the project demonstrates the ability to combine and analyze data from different tables within the dataset.

[SQL - CO2 Emissions Analysis](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/SQL-projects/tree/main/CO2_Emissions_Analysis)
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis for a dataset on CO2 emissions by vehicles. The dataset captures details on how CO2 emissions can vary with different vehicle features such as fuel type, transmission, engine size, and more. The dataset has been compiled from the Canada Government official open data website, covering a period of 7 years and was obtained from Kaggle.

[SQL - House Market Data Cleaning](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/SQL-projects/tree/main/Housing_Market_Cleaning)
This repository contains SQL queries and data cleaning operations performed on a dataset containing sale data from the Nashville housing market. The dataset captures details on property sales, addresses, dates, and other relevant information.

[Data Science Projects](https://github.com/bernardo-mcosta/data-science-projects)
These are projects focused on learning the key aspects of machine learning and data science, overall libraries usage, data manipulation and data visualization. Some of them are case studies from Data Science courses I've took.
